I saw steps to backup and restore and successfully handson! I can summarize that:

1.  Make a snapshot by etcdctl (command in a local)

2. Build snapshot -> file "member" by etcdctl (command in a local) and replace in "/var/lib/etcd-from-backup"

3. Change path in volume in  "/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml" :

     -  from  "/var/lib/etcd "  to "/var/lib/etcd-from-backup"

Thus, the directly things impact to cluster is file "member". Why don't we simply do it by: 

1. Copy file "member" from  "/var/lib/etcd" to any dir in local

2. Change  path in volume in  "/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml" : 

 -  from  "/var/lib/etcd "  to  that dir

I try this in your lab and I work! I don't know weather I was wrong handson but  true result as same as your way ? 


mkdir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup
cp /var/lib/etcd/member /var/lib/etcd-from-backup/member -r
vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
watch "crictl ps | grep etcd"
kubectl delete pod -n kube-system etcd-controlplane
